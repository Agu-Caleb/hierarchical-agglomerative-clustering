# hierarchical-agglomerative-clustering
Implementing the hierarchical agglomerative clustering with the following linkage: single, complete, average and centroid
## Aim
The purpose of these is to compare the performance of my implementations to the more popular Kmeans() for various linkages and to find the best K. The results obtained were very similar for single linkage as illustrated below.
